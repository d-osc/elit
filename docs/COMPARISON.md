const count = createState(0);
const doubled = computed([count], c => c * 2);
effect([count], c => {
  console.log(c);
});
```

### From Vue 3

```javascript
// Vue 3
const count = ref(0);
const doubled = computed(() => count.value * 2);
watch(count, (newVal) => {
  console.log(newVal);

const doubled = computed([count], c => c * 2);
count.subscribe(value => {
  console.log(value);
});
```

### From Svelte

```javascript
// Svelte
let count = 0;
$: doubled = count * 2;
$: console.log(count);

// Elit
const count = createState(0);
const doubled = computed([count], c => c * 2);
